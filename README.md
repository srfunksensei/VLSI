# Two Address Instructions (16bit CPU)

Completely functional hardware unit realized as VHDL implementation of [AOR2](https://github.com/srfunksensei/AOR2.git) project. This processor has modest possibilities and it can represent the core of a larger system, and can be be easy to upgrade it, improve its performance and embed it in any other complex application.
